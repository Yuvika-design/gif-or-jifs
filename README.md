# gif-or-jifs
I created a gif using python in just 6 lines of python code using three L's (Library, List, Loop)

🕒 Clock GIF Maker
✨ A tiny and adorable Python script to turn your favorite images into a GIF — just like magic!

🧸 What It Does
This project takes a list of images (like 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.) and stitches them together into a looping .gif called clock.gif. It uses the powerful and friendly imageio library to make the GIF creation easy and fun.

💡 Tip
Want a faster or slower animation? Just change the duration in the script:
io.imwrite("clock.gif", images, duration=1.0, loop=0)


🐣 Made with love and pixels 💖
